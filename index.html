    <!--The intro section of the Site-->
    <h1><h1 id='welcome_message'>Welcome</h1>
    <div id="day 1">
      <!--I put a devision here to play with something from an exercise-->
      <p>So this is my first website built <em>Entirely</em> in html code. 
        I am just going to use this space to experiment and try stuff. 

        I was banging my head against the wall trying to rember how to make
        a bulleted list. I ended up opening another project and copying the code
        <ul>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li><bold>JavaScript</bold></li>
        </ul>
      <p> 
        These two topics I currently consider <bold><em>The Good Stuff</em></bold> 
        and I really want to get after it.However patience!
        After a proper treatment of html, I will eventually get to them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <div id="day2">
      <p>
          so my math teacheer called in sick today so I Kinda have the day off. I figured 
          would take the oppertunity to study some more. Today is a continuation of HTML.
          I will put more as we go. Back to the lesson
      </p>
    </div>
        
    <div id="day 3">
      <h1>Day 3</h1>
      <h2>"The Good Stuff!"</h2>
      <p>
        So today I finally passed through HTML review and got onto CSS.I have been looking forward
        to learning about Cascading Style Sheets for a while. I used to simply ignore CSS, Java and the 
        like. I would look at the code and say to myself "I dont know what all that is".
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--I figure I can break it down by day and kind chronicle the learning-->

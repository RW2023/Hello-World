          So this is my first website built <em>Entirely</em> in html code. 
        I am just going to use this space to experiment and try stuff. 
          I was banging my head against the wall trying to rember how to make
        a bulleted list. I ended up opening another project and copying the code
        <ul class="content">
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li><bold>JavaScript</bold></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
          These two topics I currently consider <bold><em>The Good Stuff</em></bold> 
        and I really want to get after it. However I will patience!
        After a proper treatment of html, I will eventually get to them.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='heading'id="day2">
      <h1>Day 2</h1>
      <h2>December 23, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[Teacher Skips Class]</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
            so my math teacheer called in sick today so I Kinda have the day off. I figured 
          would take the oppertunity to study some more. Today is a continuation of HTML.
          I will put more as we go. "back to the lab again yo!"
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='heading' id="day3">
      <h1>Day 3 </h1>
      <h2>December 23, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[The Good Stuff!]</h2>

    <div class="content">

        </figure
        So today I finally passed through HTML review and got onto CSS.
        have been looking forward to learning about   
        Cascading Style Sheets for a while. I used to simply ignore CSS, Java and the 
        like. 
        >
        I would look at the code and say to myself "I dont know what all that is". I am still not 
        sure how exactly to setup a background image. I will have to wait until I get to that. I will keep 
        the blog up to date.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!--I figure I can break it down by day and kind chronicle the learning-->
    <div class='heading' id="day4">
      <h1>Day 4</h1>
      <h2>December 24, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[Merry Christmas...Eve!]</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        <strong><bold>Merry Almost Christmas!</strong></bold>
          It's Christmas eve and I just got home from working
        The first thing I find myself doing is coding. Even though at this stage it's pretty exclusively "HTML" with a
        tiny bit of Python when I tinker with one of my 3 simple projects. I am trying to train my brain to 
        become accustomed to this world. This line of thinking and seeing. I want my brain to 
        become comfortable with these patterns so that I can learn as efficiently and thoroughly
        as possible.
        </p>
    <div class='heading'id="day5">
      <h1>Day 5</h1>
      <h2>December 25, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[Merry Christmas!]</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
          So this is Christmas. It is nice to be back to "Normal" after 3 years
          of Covid Hell. I find myself alone in the basement at 4:10 am. I am 
          actuall surprised none of the kids have woken up yet to get it started.
          Today is a continuation of CSS. I am going to get as much work done before
          the kids wake up early for the routine.
        </p>
    <div class='heading'id="day6">
      <h1>Day 6</h1>
      <h2>December 26, 2022</h2>
      <h2>[Boxing Day]</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        It is 1:46 am on boxing day as I come to the end of the CSS module. 
        I took a detour and played around with Git and GitHub. 
        I also played around with MS Code to configure it
        more to my liking. I will probably add more to today's entry later on.
        I just wanted to add another day since I officially can. Yeah it's 
        my own silly rule.
